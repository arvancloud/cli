## PaaS

It is built on top of openshift client (oc) which means it provides its full capabilities to connect with any kubernetes compliant cluster, and on top adds commands simplifying interaction with an OpenShift cluster.

## Development

### Build

Building of project can be done using `build.sh` script:

```bash
./scripts/build/build.sh ~/go/bin/arvan
```
Where `~/go/bin/arvan` would be output of the project.

#### Environment Variables

`GOEXEC`: path to `go` executable. Change it if you don't want to use `go` executable defined in your PATH.

Example:

```bash
GOEXEC=/usr/lib/go-1.10/bin/go ./scripts/build/build.sh ~/go/bin/arvan
```

`BUILD_TAGS`: add build tags to `go build` process using `-tags` option.

Example:

```bash
BUILD_TAGS="include_gcs include_oss" ./scripts/build/build.sh ~/go/bin/arvan
```

`LDFLAGS`: add build tags to `go build`.

Example: disable debug information with `-s -w`:

```bash
GOEXEC=/usr/lib/go-1.10/bin/go LDFLAGS="-s -w" ./scripts/build/build.sh ~/go/bin/arvan
```

#### Shrink go binary size

Make sure you disabled debug informations using `-s -w` flags.

Use UPX to compress your binary:

```bash
upx -7 /home/vahid/go/bin/arvan
```

### Subcommand Development:

You can add any subcommand to arvan by developing a [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) command and add to to arvan as subcommand.

#### Example Subcommand

Develope your subcommand and it's functionalities in separated git repository using [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra). Assume your repository is `github.com/example/examplecli` and it have a `InitiatedCommand` function that returns your base command with type of `github.com/spf13/cobra`.`Command`. Add your project to to this repository vendor using `git submodule`:

```bash
git submodule add -b master https://github.com/example/examplecli vendor/github.com/example/examplecli
```

Create an `example` package in pkg and prepare what you need to for initializing you module in `pkg/example/example.go`:

```go
package example

import (
	example "github.com/example/examplecli"
)

// NewCmdPaas return new cobra cli for paas
func NewCmdExample(in io.Reader, out, errout io.Writer) *cobra.Command {

    exampleCommand := example.InitiatedCommand(in, out, errout)
    
    // Do whatever you need to prepare your command. e.g. login preparation.

	return exampleCommand
}
```

You can access all authentication information and general configurations of `arvan cli` by getting arvan config object using `config.GetConfigInfo()` from `git.arvan.me/arvan/cli/pkg/config`.

After you initialized and prepared your command add it to `arvan cli` as subcommand in `pkg/cli/cli.go`:

```go
package cli

import (
    .
    .
    .
	"git.arvan.me/arvan/cli/pkg/example"
)

func NewCommandCLI() *cobra.Command {
    .
    .
    .

	exampleCommand := example.NewCmdExample(in, out, errout)
	cmd.AddCommand(exampleCommand)

	return cmd
}
```
